For NVIDIA-GPU installation:
----------------------------

The current release has been tested with CUDA versions from 9.0 to 10.2.
CUDA version 11 introduces some changes and may not work directly out of the box without some changes.

1. H2Opus on GPUs has two external dependencies, MAGMA and KBLAS, which should be installed.
    * git clone  https://bitbucket.org/icl/magma.git
      to download MAGMA and follow its installation instructions.
    * git clone https://github.com/ecrc/kblas-gpu.git
      to download KBLAS and follow its installation instructions and provide a path to the CUB library
    * git clone  https://github.com/NVlabs/cub.git
      to download CUB. CUB is a header-only library and no particular installation is necessary.

2. Install the H2Opus library.
    * create a make.inc file to customize the build of the library. Edit it to specify whether a GPU is available (H2OPUS_USE_GPU=1), whether to use MKL (H2OPUS_USE_MKL=1), and whether to use single precision (H2OPUS_USE_SINGLE_PRECISION=1, default is double precision). The file should also be edited to specify the install paths of the dependencies above and the compute capabilities of the target GPU.
    * examples can be found in make.inc.cpu (CPU build) or make.inc.gpu (CPU-GPU build). These files have been tested with GNU and Intel.
    * type 'make' to configure, compile and build the library
    * type 'make check' to verify a correct build and compile all the examples
    * type 'make distclean' before trying a different configuration

3. Test one of the examples.
    * go to the examples/ directory
    * go to the hgemv/ folder example
    * type 'make' to build this example.
    * run it with './test_hgemv --help' to see the options that can be set. The README.md file in this folder has a high-level explanation of the code.



For CPU-only installation:
--------------------------

1. Install the Thrust library
      * git clone https://github.com/thrust/thrust.git
        Thrust is a header only library and no particular installation is necessary.

After installing Thrust, follow steps 2 and 3 above.
